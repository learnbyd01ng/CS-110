discernible 1
in 1
it 1
the 1
objection 1
would 1
still 1
remain 1
that 1
to 1
suppose 1
a 1
work 1
of 1
mere 1
burlesque 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
primary 1
effort 1
of 1
poetry 1
in 1
a 1
simple 1
age 1
seems 1
to 1
reverse 1
that 1
order 1
in 1
the 1
development 1
of 1
national 1
taste 1
which 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
every 1
other 1
people 1
in 1
europe 1
and 1
of 1
many 1
in 1
asia 1
has 1
almost 1
ascertained 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
law 1
of 1
the 1
human 1
mind 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
a 1
state 1
of 1
society 1
much 1
more 1
refined 1
and 1
permanent 1
than 1
that 1
described 1
in 1
the 1
iliad 1
that 1
any 1
popularity 1
would 1
attend 1
such 1
a 1
ridicule 1
of 1
war 1
and 1
the 1
gods 1
as 1
is 1
contained 1
in 1
this 1
poem 1
and 1
the 1
fact 1
of 1
there 1
having 1
existed 1
three 1
other 1
poems 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
kind 1
attributed 1
for 1
aught 1
we 1
can 1
see 1
with 1
as 1
much 1
reason 1
to 1
homer 1
is 1
a 1
strong 1
inducement 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
none 1
of 1
them 1
were 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
age 1
knight 1
infers 1
from 1
the 1
usage 1
of 1
the 1
word 1
deltoz 1
writing 1
tablet 1
instead 1
of 1
diphthera 1
skin 1
which 1
according 1
to 1
herod 1
5 1
58 1
was 1
the 1
material 1
employed 1
by 1
the 1
asiatic 1
greeks 1
for 1
that 1
purpose 1
that 1
this 1
poem 1
was 1
another 1
offspring 1
of 1
attic 1
ingenuity 1
and 1
generally 1
that 1
the 1
familiar 1
mention 1
of 1
the 1
cock 1
v 1
191 1
is 1
a 1
strong 1
argument 1
against 1
so 1
ancient 1
a 1
date 1
for 1
its 1
composition 1
having 1
thus 1
given 1
a 1
brief 1
account 1
of 1
the 1
poems 1
comprised 1
in 1
popes 1
design 1
i 1
will 1
now 1
proceed 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
few 1
remarks 1
on 1
his 1
translation 1
and 1
on 1
my 1
own 1
purpose 1
in 1
the 1
present 1
edition 1
pope 1
was 1
not 1
a 1
grecian 1
his 1
whole 1
education 1
had 1
been 1
irregular 1
and 1
his 1
earliest 1
acquaintance 1
with 1
the 1
poet 1
was 1
through 1
the 1
version 1
of 1
ogilby 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
too 1
much 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
his 1
whole 1
work 1
bears 1
the 1
impress 1
of 1
a 1
disposition 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
with 1
the 1
general 1
sense 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
dive 1
deeply 1
into 1
the 1
minute 1
and 1
delicate 1
features 1
of 1
language 1
hence 1
his 1
whole 1
work 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
looked 1
upon 1
rather 1
as 1
an 1
elegant 1
paraphrase 1
than 1
a 1
translation 1
there 1
are 1
to 1
be 1
sure 1
certain 1
conventional 1
anecdotes 1
which 1
prove 1
that 1
pope 1
consulted 1
various 1
friends 1
whose 1
classical 1
attainments 1
were 1
sounder 1
than 1
his 1
own 1
during 1
the 1
undertaking 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
probable 1
that 1
these 1
examinations 1
were 1
the 1
result 1
rather 1
of 1
the 1
contradictory 1
versions 1
already 1
existing 1
than 1
of 1
a 1
desire 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
perfect 1
transcript 1
of 1
the 1
original 1
and 1
in 1
those 1
days 1
what 1
is 1
called 1
literal 1
translation 1
was 1
less 1
cultivated 1
than 1
at 1
present 1
if 1
something 1
like 1
the 1
general 1
sense 1
could 1
be 1
decorated 1
with 1
the 1
easy 1
gracefulness 1
of 1
a 1
practised 1
poet 1
if 1
the 1
charms 1
of 1
metrical 1
cadence 1
and 1
a 1
pleasing 1
fluency 1
could 1
be 1
made 1
consistent 1
with 1
a 1
fair 1
interpretation 1
of 1
the 1
poets 1
meaning 1
his 1
words 1
were 1
less 1
jealously 1
sought 1
for 1
and 1
those 1
who 1
could 1
read 1
so 1
good 1
a 1
poem 1
as 1
popes 1
iliad 1
had 1
fair 1
reason 1
to 1
be 1
satisfied 1
it 1
would 1
