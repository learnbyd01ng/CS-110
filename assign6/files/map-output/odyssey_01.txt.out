of 1

content 1
with 1
what 1
we 1
at 1
present 1
know 1
is 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
to 1
shut 1
our 1
ears 1
against 1
conviction 1
since 1
from 1
the 1
very 1
gradual 1
character 1
of 1
our 1
education 1
we 1
must 1
continually 1
forget 1
and 1
emancipate 1
ourselves 1
from 1
knowledge 1
previously 1
acquired 1
we 1
must 1
set 1
aside 1
old 1
notions 1
and 1
embrace 1
fresh 1
ones 1
and 1
as 1
we 1
learn 1
we 1
must 1
be 1
daily 1
unlearning 1
something 1
which 1
it 1
has 1
cost 1
us 1
no 1
small 1
labour 1
and 1
anxiety 1
to 1
acquire 1
and 1
this 1
difficulty 1
attaches 1
itself 1
more 1
closely 1
to 1
an 1
age 1
in 1
which 1
progress 1
has 1
gained 1
a 1
strong 1
ascendency 1
over 1
prejudice 1
and 1
in 1
which 1
persons 1

things 1

day 1

their 1
real 1
level 1
in 1

of 1
their 1
conventional 1

principles 1
which 1

swept 1

which 1
are 1
making 1
rapid 1
havoc 1
among 1
the 1

be 1
estimated 1
by 1
the 1
standard 1
which 1
human 1

whether 1
actual 1
or 1
traditionary 1
has 1
furnished 1
to 1
form 1
correct 1
views 1
of 1
individuals 1
we 1
must 1
regard 1
them 1
as 1
forming 1
parts 1
of 1
a 1
great 1
wholewe 1
must 1
measure 1
them 1
by 1
their 1
relation 1
to 1
the 1
mass 1
of 1
beings 1
by 1
whom 1
they 1
are 1
surrounded 1
and 1
in 1
contemplating 1
the 1
incidents 1
in 1
their 1
lives 1
or 1
condition 1
which 1
tradition 1
has 1
handed 1
down 1
to 1
us 1
we 1
must 1
rather 1
consider 1
the 1
general 1
bearing 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
narrative 1
than 1
the 1
respective 1
probability 1
of 1
its 1
details 1
it 1
is 1
unfortunate 1
for 1
us 1
that 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
men 1
we 1
know 1
least 1
and 1
talk 1
most 1
homer 1
socrates 1
and 1
shakespere 1
have 1
perhaps 1
contributed 1
more 1
to 1
the 1
intellectual 1
enlightenment 1
of 1
mankind 1
than 1
any 1
other 1
three 1
writers 1
who 1
could 1
be 1
named 1
and 1
yet 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
all 1
three 1
has 1
given 1
rise 1
to 1
a 1
boundless 1
ocean 1
of 1
discussion 1
which 1
has 1
left 1
us 1
little 1
save 1
the 1
option 1
of 1
choosing 1
which 1
theory 1
or 1
theories 1
we 1
will 1
follow 1
the 1
personality 1
of 1
shakespere 1
is 1
perhaps 1
the 1
only 1
thing 1
in 1
which 1
critics 1
will 1
allow 1
us 1
to 1
believe 1
without 1
controversy 1
but 1
upon 1
everything 1
else 1
even 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
authorship 1
of 1
plays 1
there 1
is 1
more 1
or 1
less 1
of 1
doubt 1
and 1
uncertainty 1
of 1
socrates 1
we 1
know 1
as 1
little 1
as 1
the 1
contradictions 1
of 1
plato 1
and 1
xenophon 1
will 1
allow 1
us 1
to 1
know 1
he 1
was 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
dramatis 1
personae 1
in 1
two 1
dramas 1
as 1
unlike 1
in 1
principles 1
as 1
in 1
style 1
he 1
appears 1
as 1
the 1
enunciator 1
of 1
opinions 1
as 1
different 1
in 1
their 1
tone 1
as 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
writers 1
who 1
have 1
handed 1
them 1
down 1
when 1
we 1
have 1
read 1
plato 1
or 1
xenophon 1
we 1
think 1
we 1
know 1
something 1
of 1
socrates 1
when 1
we 1
have 1
fairly 1
read 1
and 1
examined 1
both 1
we 1
feel 1
convinced 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
something 1
worse 1
than 1
ignorant 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
an 1
easy 1
and 1
a 1
popular 1
expedient 1
of 1
late 1
years 1
to 1
deny 1
the 1
personal 1
or 1
real 1
existence 1
of 1
men 1
and 1
things 1
whose 1
life 1
and 1
condition 1
were 1
too 1
much 1
for 1
our 1
belief 1
this 1
systemwhich 1
has 1
often 1
comforted 1
the 1
religious 1
sceptic 1
and 1
substituted 1
the 1
consolations 1
of 1
strauss 1
for 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
new 1
testamenthas 1
been 1
of 1
incalculable 1
value 1
to 1
the 1
historical 1
theorists 1
of 1
the 1
last 1
and 1
present 1
centuries 1
to 1
question 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
alexander 1
the 1
great 1
would 1
be 1
a 1
more 1
excusable 1
act 1
than 1
to 1
believe 1
in 1
that 1
of 1
romulus 1
to 1
deny 1
a 1
fact 1
related 1
in 1
herodotus 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
inconsistent 1
with 1
a 1
theory 1
developed 1
from 1
an 1
assyrian 1
inscription 1
which 1
no 1
two 1
scholars 1
read 1
in 1
the 1
same 1
way 1
is 1
more 1
pardonable 1
than 1
to 1
believe 1
in 1
the 1
goodnatured 1
old 1
king 1
whom 1
the 1
elegant 1
pen 1
of 1
florian 1
has 1
idealizednuma 1
pompilius 1
scepticism 1
has 1
attained 1
its 1
culminating 1
point 1
with 1
respect 1
to 1
homer 1
and 1
the 1
state 1
of 1
our 1
homeric 1
knowledge 1
may 1
be 1
described 1
as 1
a 1
free 1
permission 1
to 1
believe 1
any 1
theory 1
provided 1
we 1
throw 1
overboard 1
all 1
written 1
tradition 1
concerning 1
the 1
author 1
or 1
authors 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
what 1
few 1
authorities 1
exist 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
are 1
summarily 1
dismissed 1
although 1
the 1
arguments 1
appear 1
to 1
run 1
in 1
a 1
circle 1
this 1
cannot 1
be 1
true 1
because 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
and 1
that 1
is 1
not 1
true 1
because 1
it 1
cannot 1
be 1
true 1
such 1
seems 1
to 1
be 1
the 1
style 1
in 1
which 1
testimony 1
upon 1
testimony 1
statement 1
upon 1
statement 1
is 1
consigned 1
to 1
denial 1
and 1
oblivion 1
it 1
is 1
however 1
unfortunate 1
that 1
the 1
professed 1
biographies 1
of 1
homer 1
are 1
partly 1
forgeries 1
partly 1
freaks 1
of 1
ingenuity 1
and 1
imagination 1
in 1
which 1
truth 1
is 1
the 1
requisite 1
most 1
wanting 1
before 1
taking 1
a 1
brief 1
review 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
theory 1
in 1
its 1
present 1
conditions 1
some 1
notice 1
must 1
be 1
taken 1
of 1
the 1
treatise 1
on 1
the 1
life 1
of 1
homer 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
attributed 1
to 1
herodotus 1
according 1
to 1
this 1
document 1
the 1
city 1
of 1
cumae 1
in 1
aeolia 1
was 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
period 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
frequent 1
immigrations 1
from 1
various 1
parts 1
of 1
greece 1
among 1
the 1
immigrants 1
was 1
menapolus 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
ithagenes 1
although 1
poor 1
he 1
married 1
and 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
the 1
union 1
was 1
a 1
girl 1
named 1
critheis 1
the 1
girl 1
was 1
left 1
an 1
orphan 1
at 1
an 1
early 1
age 1
under 1
the 1
guardianship 1
of 1
cleanax 1
of 1
argos 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
indiscretion 1
of 1
this 1
maiden 1
that 1
we 1
are 1
indebted 1
for 1
so 1
much 1
happiness 1
homer 1
was 1
the 1
first 1
fruit 1
of 1
her 1
juvenile 1
frailty 1
and 1
received 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
melesigenes 1
from 1
having 1
been 1
born 1
near 1
the 1
river 1
meles 1
in 1
boeotia 1
whither 1
critheis 1
had 1
been 1
transported 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
save 1
her 1
reputation 1
at 1
this 1
time 1
continues 1
our 1
narrative 1
there 1
lived 1
at 1
smyrna 1
a 1
man 1
named 1
phemius 1
a 1
teacher 1
of 1
literature 1
and 1
music 1
who 1
not 1
being 1
married 1
engaged 1
critheis 1
to 1
manage 1
his 1
household 1
and 1
spin 1
the 1
flax 1
he 1
received 1
as 1
the 1
price 1
of 1
his 1
scholastic 1
labours 1
so 1
satisfactory 1
was 1
her 1
performance 1
of 1
this 1
task 1
and 1
so 1
modest 1
her 1
conduct 1
that 1
he 1
made 1
proposals 1
of 1
marriage 1
declaring 1
himself 1
as 1
a 1
further 1
inducement 1
willing 1
to 1
adopt 1
her 1
son 1
who 1
he 1
asserted 1
would 1
become 1
a 1
clever 1
man 1
if 1
he 1
were 1
carefully 1
brought 1
up 1
they 1
were 1
married 1
careful 1
cultivation 1
ripened 1
the 1
talents 1
which 1
nature 1
had 1
bestowed 1
and 1
melesigenes 1
soon 1
surpassed 1
his 1
schoolfellows 1
in 1
every 1
attainment 1
and 1
when 1
older 1
rivalled 1
his 1
preceptor 1
in 1
wisdom 1
phemius 1
died 1
leaving 1
him 1
sole 1
heir 1
to 1
his 1
property 1
and 1
his 1
mother 1
soon 1
followed 1
melesigenes 1
carried 1
on 1
his 1
adopted 1
fathers 1
school 1
with 1
great 1
success 1
exciting 1
the 1
admiration 1
not 1
only 1
of 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
smyrna 1
but 1
also 1
of 1
the 1
strangers 1
whom 1
the 1
trade 1
carried 1
on 1
there 1
especially 1
in 1
the 1
exportation 1
of 1
corn 1
attracted 1
to 1
that 1
city 1
among 1
these 1
visitors 1
one 1
mentes 1
from 1
leucadia 1
the 1
modern 1
santa 1
maura 1
who 1
evinced 1
a 1
knowledge 1
and 1
intelligence 1
rarely 1
found 1
in 1
those 1
times 1
persuaded 1
melesigenes 1
to 1
close 1
his 1
school 1
and 1
accompany 1
him 1
on 1
his 1
travels 1
he 1
promised 1
not 1
only 1
to 1
pay 1
his 1
expenses 1
but 1
to 1
furnish 1
him 1
with 1
a 1
further 1
stipend 1
urging 1
that 1
while 1
he 1
was 1
yet 1
young 1
it 1
was 1
fitting 1
that 1
he 1
should 1
see 1
with 1
his 1
own 1
eyes 1
the 1
countries 1
and 1
cities 1
which 1
might 1
hereafter 1
be 1
the 1
subjects 1
of 1
his 1
discourses 1
melesigenes 1
consented 1
and 1
set 1
out 1
with 1
his 1
patron 1
examining 1
all 1
the 1
curiosities 1
of 1
the 1
countries 1
they 1
visited 1
and 1
informing 1
himself 1
of 1
everything 1
by 1
interrogating 1
those 1
whom 1
he 1
met 1
we 1
may 1
also 1
suppose 1
that 1
he 1
wrote 1
memoirs 1
of 1
all 1
that 1
he 1
deemed 1
worthy 1
of 1
preservation 1
having 1
set 1
sail 1
from 1
tyrrhenia 1
and 1
iberia 1
they 1
reached 1
ithaca 1
here 1
melesigenes 1
who 1
had 1
already 1
suffered 1
in 1
his 1
eyes 1
became 1
much 1
worse 1
and 1
mentes 1
who 1
was 1
about 1
to 1
leave 1
for 1
leucadia 1
left 1
him 1
to 1
the 1
medical 1
superintendence 1
of 1
a 1
friend 1
of 1
his 1
named 1
mentor 1
the 1
son 1
of 1
alcinor 1
under 1
his 1
hospitable 1
and 1
intelligent 1
host 1
melesigenes 1
rapidly 1
became 1
acquainted 1
with 1
the 1
legends 1
respecting 1
ulysses 1
which 1
afterwards 1
formed 1
the 1
subject 1
of 1
the 1
odyssey 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
of 1
ithaca 1
assert 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
here 1
that 1
melesigenes 1
became 1
blind 1
but 1
the 1
colophonians 1
make 1
their 1
city 1
the 1
seat 1
of 1
that 1
misfortune 1
he 1
then 1
returned 1
to 1
smyrna 1
where 1
he 1
applied 1
himself 1
to 1
the 1
study 1
of 1
poetry 1
but 1
poverty 1
soon 1
drove 1
him 1
to 1
cumae 1
having 1
passed 1
over 1
the 1
hermaean 1
plain 1
he 1
arrived 1
at 1
neon 1
teichos 1
the 1
new 1
wall 1
a 1
colony 1
of 1
cumae 1
here 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
and 1
poetical 1
talent 1
gained 1
him 1
the 1
friendship 1
of 1
one 1
tychias 1
an 1
armourer 1
and 1
up 1
to 1
my 1
time 1
continues 1
the 1
author 1
the 1
inhabitants 1
showed 1
the 1
place 1
where 1
he 1
used 1
to 1
sit 1
when 1
giving 1
a 1
recitation 1
of 1
his 1
verses 1
and 1
they 1
greatly 1
honoured 1
the 1
spot 1
here 1
also 1
a 1
poplar 1
grew 1
which 1
they 1
said 1
had 1
sprung 1
up 1
ever 1
since 1
melesigenes 1
arrived 1
but 1
poverty 1
still 1
drove 1
him 1
on 1
and 1
he 1
went 1
by 1
way 1
of 1
larissa 1
as 1
being 1
the 1
most 1
convenient 1
road 1
here 1
the 1
cumans 1
say 1
he 1
composed 1
an 1
epitaph 1
on 1
gordius 1
king 1
of 1
phrygia 1
which 1
has 1
however 1
and 1
with 1
greater 1
probability 1
been 1
attributed 1
to 1
cleobulus 1
of 1
lindus 1
arrived 1
at 1
cumae 1
he 1
frequented 1
the 1
conversaziones 1
of 1
the 1
old 1
men 1
and 1
delighted 1
all 1
by 1
the 1
charms 1
of 1
his 1
poetry 1
encouraged 1
by 1
this 1
favourable 1
reception 1
he 1
declared 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
would 1
allow 1
him 1
a 1
public 1
maintenance 1
he 1
would 1
render 1
their 1
city 1
most 1
gloriously 1
renowned 1
they 1
avowed 1
their 1
willingness 1
to 1
support 1
him 1
in 1
the 1
measure 1
he 1
proposed 1
and 1
procured 1
him 1
an 1
audience 1
in 1
the 1
council 1
having 1
made 1
the 1
speech 1
with 1
the 1
purport 1
of 1
which 1
our 1
author 1
has 1
forgotten 1
to 1
acquaint 1
us 1
he 1
retired 1
and 1
left 1
them 1
to 1
debate 1
respecting 1
the 1
answer 1
to 1
be 1
given 1
to 1
his 1
proposal 1
the 1
greater 1
part 1
of 1
the 1
assembly 1
seemed 1
favourable 1
to 1
the 1
poets 1
demand 1
but 1
one 1
man 1
observed 1
that 1
if 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
feed 1
homers 1
they 1
would 1
be 1
encumbered 1
with 1
a 1
multitude 1
of 1
useless 1
people 1
from 1
this 1
circumstance 1
says 1
the 1
writer 1
melesigenes 1
acquired 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
homer 1
for 1
the 1
cumans 1
call 1
blind 1
men 1
homers 1
with 1
a 1
love 1
of 1
economy 1
which 1
shows 1
how 1
similar 1
the 1
world 1
has 1
always 1
been 1
in 1
its 1
treatment 1
of 1
literary 1
men 1
the 1
pension 1
was 1
denied 1
and 1
the 1
poet 1
vented 1
his 1
disappointment 1
in 1
a 1
wish 1
that 1
cumae 1
might 1
never 1
produce 1
a 1
poet 1
capable 1
of 1
giving 1
it 1
renown 1
and 1
glory 1
at 1
phocaea 1
homer 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
experience 1
another 1
literary 1
distress 1
one 1
thestorides 1
who 1
aimed 1
at 1
the 1
reputation 1
of 1
poetical 1
genius 1
kept 1
homer 1
in 1
his 1
own 1
house 1
and 1
allowed 1
him 1
a 1
pittance 1
on 1
condition 1
of 1
the 1
verses 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
passing 1
in 1
his 1
name 1
having 1
collected 1
sufficient 1
poetry 1
to 1
be 1
profitable 1
thestorides 1
like 1
some 1
wouldbe 1
literary 1
publishers 1
neglected 1
the 1
man 1
whose 1
brains 1
he 1
had 1
sucked 1
and 1
left 1
him 1
at 1
his 1
departure 1
homer 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
observed 1
o 1
thestorides 1
of 1
the 1
many 1
things 1
hidden 1
from 1
the 1
knowledge 1
of 1
man 1
nothing 1
is 1
more 1
unintelligible 1
than 1
the 1
human 1
heart 1
homer 1
continued 1
his 1
career 1
of 1
difficulty 1
and 1
distress 1
until 1
some 1
chian 1
merchants 1
struck 1
by 1
the 1
similarity 1
of 1
the 1
verses 1
they 1
heard 1
him 1
recite 1
acquainted 1
him 1
with 1
the 1
fact 1
that 1
thestorides 1
was 1
pursuing 1
a 1
profitable 1
livelihood 1
by 1
the 1
recital 1
of 1
the 1
very 1
same 1
poems 1
this 1
at 1
once 1
determined 1
him 1
to 1
set 1
out 1
for 1
chios 1
no 1
vessel 1
happened 1
then 1
to 1
be 1
setting 1
sail 1
thither 1
but 1
he 1
found 1
one 1
ready 1
to 1
start 1
for 1
erythrae 1
a 1
town 1
of 1
ionia 1
which 1
faces 1
that 1
island 1
and 1
he 1
prevailed 1
upon 1
the 1
seamen 1
to 1
allow 1
him 1
to 1
accompany 1
them 1
having 1
embarked 1
he 1
invoked 1
a 1
favourable 1
wind 1
and 1
prayed 1
that 1
he 1
might 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
expose 1
the 1
imposture 1
of 1
thestorides 1
who 1
by 1
his 1
breach 1
of 1
hospitality 1
had 1
drawn 1
down 1
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
jove 1
the 1
hospitable 1
at 1
erythrae 1
homer 1
fortunately 1
met 1
with 1
a 1
person 1
who 1
had 1
known 1
him 1
in 1
phocaea 1
by 1
whose 1
assistance 1
he 1
at 1
length 1
after 1
some 1
difficulty 1
reached 1
the 1
little 1
hamlet 1
of 1
pithys 1
here 1
he 1
met 1
with 1
an 1
adventure 1
which 1
we 1
will 1
continue 1
in 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
our 1
author 1
having 1
set 1
out 1
from 1
pithys 1
homer 1
went 1
on 1
attracted 1
by 1
the 1
cries 1
of 1
some 1
goats 1
that 1
were 1
pasturing 1
the 1
dogs 1
barked 1
on 1
his 1
approach 1
and 1
he 1
cried 1
out 1
glaucus 1
for 1
that 1
was 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
the 1
goatherd 1
heard 1
his 1
voice 1
ran 1
up 1
quickly 1
called 1
off 1
his 1
dogs 1
and 1
drove 1
them 1
away 1
from 1
homer 1
for 1
some 1
time 1
he 1
stood 1
wondering 1
how 1
a 1
blind 1
man 1
should 1
have 1
reached 1
such 1
a 1
place 1
alone 1
and 1
what 1
could 1
be 1
his 1
design 1
in 1
coming 1
he 1
then 1
went 1
up 1
to 1
him 1
and 1
inquired 1
who 1
he 1
was 1
and 1
how 1
he 1
had 1
come 1
to 1
desolate 1
places 1
and 1
untrodden 1
spots 1
and 1
of 1
what 1
he 1
stood 1
in 1
need 1
homer 1
by 1
recounting 1
to 1
him 1
the 1
whole 1
history 1
of 1
his 1
misfortunes 1
moved 1
him 1
with 1
compassion 1
and 1
he 1
took 1
him 1
and 1
led 1
him 1
to 1
his 1
cot 1
and 1
having 1
lit 1
a 1
fire 1
bade 1
him 1
sup 1
the 1
dogs 1
instead 1
of 1
eating 1
kept 1
barking 1
at 1
the 1
stranger 1
according 1
to 1
their 1
usual 1
habit 1
whereupon 1
homer 1
addressed 1
glaucus 1
thus 1
o 1
glaucus 1
my 1
friend 1
prythee 1
attend 1
to 1
my 1
behest 1
first 1
give 1
the 1
dogs 1
their 1
supper 1
at 1
the 1
doors 1
of 1
the 1
hut 1
for 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
better 1
since 1
whilst 1
they 1
watch 1
nor 1
thief 1
nor 1
wild 1
beast 1
will 1
approach 1
the 1
fold 1
glaucus 1
was 1
pleased 1
with 1
the 1
advice 1
and 1
marvelled 1
at 1
its 1
author 1
having 1
finished 1
supper 1
they 1
banqueted 1
afresh 1
on 1
conversation 1
homer 1
narrating 1
his 1
wanderings 1
and 1
telling 1
of 1
the 1
cities 1
he 1
had 1
visited 1
at 1
length 1
they 1
retired 1
to 1
rest 1
but 1
on 1
the 1
following 1
morning 1
glaucus 1
resolved 1
to 1
go 1
to 1
his 1
master 1
and 1
acquaint 1
him 1
with 1
his 1
meeting 1
with 1
homer 1
having 1
left 1
the 1
goats 1
in 1
charge 1
of 1
a 1
fellowservant 1
he 1
left 1
homer 1
at 1
home 1
promising 1
to 1
return 1
quickly 1
having 1
arrived 1
at 1
bolissus 1
a 1
place 1
near 1
the 1
farm 1
and 1
finding 1
his 1
mate 1
he 1
told 1
him 1
the 1
whole 1
story 1
respecting 1
homer 1
and 1
his 1
journey 1
he 1
paid 1
little 1
attention 1
to 1
what 1
he 1
said 1
and 1
blamed 1
glaucus 1
for 1
his 1
stupidity 1
in 1
taking 1
in 1
and 1
feeding 1
maimed 1
and 1
enfeebled 1
persons 1
however 1
he 1
bade 1
him 1
bring 1
the 1
stranger 1
to 1
him 1
glaucus 1
told 1
homer 1
what 1
had 1
taken 1
place 1
and 1
bade 1
him 1
follow 1
him 1
assuring 1
him 1
that 1
good 1
fortune 1
would 1
be 1
the 1
result 1
conversation 1
soon 1
showed 1
that 1
the 1
stranger 1
was 1
a 1
man 1
of 1
much 1
cleverness 1
and 1
general 1
knowledge 1
and 1
the 1
chian 1
persuaded 1
him 1
to 1
remain 1
and 1
to 1
undertake 1
the 1
charge 1
of 1
his 1
children 1
besides 1
the 1
satisfaction 1
of 1
driving 1
the 1
impostor 1
thestorides 1
from 1
the 1
island 1
homer 1
enjoyed 1
considerable 1
success 1
as 1
a 1
teacher 1
in 1
the 1
town 1
of 1
chios 1
he 1
established 1
a 1
school 1
where 1
he 1
taught 1
the 1
precepts 1
of 1
poetry 1
to 1
this 1
day 1
says 1
chandler 1
the 1
most 1
curious 1
remain 1
is 1
that 1
which 1
has 1
been 1
named 1
without 1
reason 1
the 1
school 1
of 1
homer 1
it 1
is 1
on 1
the 1
coast 1
at 1
some 1
distance 1
from 1
the 1
city 1
northward 1
and 1
appears 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
an 1
open 1
temple 1
of 1
cybele 1
formed 1
on 1
the 1
top 1
of 1
a 1
rock 1
the 1
shape 1
is 1
oval 1
and 1
in 1
the 1
centre 1
is 1
the 1
image 1
of 1
the 1
goddess 1
the 1
head 1
and 1
an 1
arm 1
wanting 1
she 1
is 1
represented 1
as 1
usual 1

a 1
lion 1
carved 1
on 1

side 1
and 1
on 1
the 1
back 1
the 1
area 1
is 1
bounded 1
by 1
a 1
low 1
rim 1
or 1
seat 1
and 1
about 1
five 1
yards 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1

hewn 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
mountain 1
is 1
rude 1
indistinct 1
and 1
probably 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
remote 1
antiquity 1
so 1
successful 1
was 1
this 1
school 1
that 1
homer 1
realised 1
a 1
considerable 1
fortune 1
he 1
married 1
and 1
had 1
two 1
daughters 1
one 1
of 1
whom 1
died 1
single 1
the 1
other 1
married 1
a 1
chian 1
the 1
following 1
passage 1
betrays 1
the 1
same 1
tendency 1
to 1
connect 1
the 1
personages 1
of 1
the 1
poems 1
with 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
which 1
has 1
already 1
been 1
mentioned 1
in 1
his 1
poetical 1
compositions 1
homer 1
displays 1
great 1
gratitude 1
towards 1
mentor 1
of 1
ithaca 1
in 1
the 1
odyssey 1
whose 1
name 1
he 1
has 1
inserted 1
in 1
his 1
poem 1
as 1
the 1
companion 1
of 1
ulysses 1
in 1
return 1
for 1
the 1
care 1
taken 1
of 1
him 1
when 1
afflicted 1
with 1
blindness 1
he 1
also 1
testifies 1
his 1
gratitude 1
to 1
phemius 1
who 1
had 1
given 1
him 1
both 1
sustenance 1
and 1
instruction 1
his 1
celebrity 1
continued 1
to 1
increase 1
and 1
many 1
persons 1
advised 1
him 1
to 1
visit 1
greece 1
whither 1
his 1
reputation 1
had 1
now 1
extended 1
having 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
made 1
some 1
additions 1
to 1
his 1
poems 1
calculated 1
to 1
please 1
the 1
vanity 1
of 1
the 1
athenians 1
of 1
whose 1
city 1
he 1
had 1
hitherto 1
made 1
no 1
mention 1
he 1
set 1
out 1
for 1
samos 1
here 1
being 1
recognized 1
by 1
a 1
samian 1
who 1
had 1
met 1
with 1
him 1
in 1
chios 1
he 1
was 1
handsomely 1
received 1
and 1
invited 1
to 1
join 1
in 1
celebrating 1
the 1
apaturian 1
festival 1
he 1
recited 1
some 1
verses 1
which 1
gave 1
great 1
satisfaction 1
and 1
by 1
singing 1
the 1
eiresione 1
at 1
the 1
new 1
moon 1
festivals 1
he 1
earned 1
a 1
subsistence 1
visiting 1
the 1
houses 1
of 1
the 1
rich 1
with 1
whose 1
children 1
he 1
was 1
very 1
popular 1
in 1
the 1
spring 1
he 1
sailed 1
for 1
athens 1
and 1
arrived 1
at 1
the 1
island 1
of 1
ios 1
now 1
ino 1
where 1
he 1
fell 1
extremely 1
ill 1
and 1
died 1
it 1
is 1
said 1
that 1
his 1
death 1
arose 1
from 1
vexation 1
at 1
not 1
having 1
been 1
able 1
to 1
unravel 1
an 1
enigma 1
proposed 1
by 1
some 1
fishermens 1
children 1
such 1
is 1
in 1
brief 1
the 1
substance 1
of 1
the 1
earliest 1
life 1
of 1
homer 1
we 1
possess 1
and 1
so 1
broad 1
are 1
the 1
evidences 1
of 1
its 1
historical 1
worthlessness 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
scarcely 1
necessary 1
to 1
point 1
them 1
out 1
in 1
detail 1
let 1
us 1
now 1
consider 1
some 1
of 1
the 1
opinions 1
to 1
which 1
a 1
persevering 1
patient 1
and 1
learnedbut 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
consistentseries 1
of 1
investigations 1
has 1
led 1
in 1
doing 1
so 1
i 1
profess 1
to 1
bring 1
forward 1
statements 1
not 1
to 1
vouch 1
for 1
their 1
reasonableness 1
or 1
probability 1
homer 1
appeared 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
this 1
poet 1
and 1
his 1
works 1
is 1
lost 1
in 1
doubtful 1
obscurity 1
as 1
is 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
many 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
minds 1
who 1
have 1
done 1
honour 1
to 1
humanity 1
because 1
they 1
rose 1
amidst 1
darkness 1
the 1
majestic 1
stream 1
of 1
his 1
song 1
blessing 1
and 1
fertilizing 1
flows 1
like 1
the 1
nile 1
through 1
many 1
lands 1
and 1
nations 1
and 1
like 1
the 1
sources 1
of 1
the 1
nile 1
its 1
fountains 1
will 1
ever 1
remain 1
concealed 1
such 1
are 1
the 1
words 1
in 1
which 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
judicious 1
german 1
critics 1
has 1
eloquently 1
described 1
the 1
uncertainty 1
in 1
which 1
the 1
whole 1
of 1
the 1

question 1
is 1
involved 1
with 1
no 1

truth 1
and 1
feeling 1
he 1
proceeds 1
it 1
seems 1
here 1
of 1
chief 1
importance 1
to 1
expect 1
no 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
nature 1
of 1
things 1
makes 1
possible 1
if 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
tradition 1
in 1
history 1
is 1
the 1
region 1
of 1
twilight 1
we 1
should 1
not 1
expect 1
in 1
it 1
perfect 1
light 1
the 1
creations 1
of 1
genius 1
always 1
seem 1
like 1
miracles 1
because 1
they 1
are 1
for 1
the 1
most 1
part 1
created 1
far 1
out 1
of 1
the 1
reach 1
of 1
observation 1
if 1
we 1
were 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
all 1
the 1
historical 1
testimonies 1
we 1
never 1
could 1
wholly 1
explain 1
the 1
origin 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
the 1
odyssey 1
for 1
their 1
origin 1
in 1
all 1
essential 1
points 1
must 1
have 1
remained 1
the 1
secret 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
from 1
this 1
criticism 1
which 1
shows 1
as 1
much 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
depths 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1

into 1
the 1
minute 1

us 1
pass 1
on 1
to 1
the 1
main 1
question 1
at 1

was 1
homer 1
an 1
individual 1
or 1
were 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
an 1
ingenious 1
arrangement 1
of 1
fragments 1
by 1
earlier 1
poets 1
well 1
has 1
landor 1
remarked 1
some 1
tell 1
us 1
there 1
were 1
twenty 1
homers 1
some 1
deny 1
that 1
there 1
was 1
ever 1
one 1

idle 1
and 1
foolish 1
to 1
shake 1
the 1
contents 1
of 1
a 1
vase 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
let 1
them 1
settle 1
at 1

we 1
are 1
perpetually 1

composure 1
our 1
devotion 1
to 1
superior 1

the 1

on 1

we 1
least 1
know 1
what 1
is 1
good 1
for 1
us 1
my 1
opinion 1
is 1
that 1
what 1
is 1
best 1
for 1
us 1
is 1
our 1
admiration 1
of 1
good 1
no 1
man 1
living 1
venerates 1
homer 1
more 1
than 1
i 1
do 1

greatly 1
as 1
we 1
admire 1
the 1
generous 1
enthusiasm 1
which 1
rests 1
contented 1
with 1
the 1
poetry 1

its 1
best 1
impulses 1

been 1
nurtured 1

fostered 1

analysis 1
our 1

compels 1
us 1
to 1
give 1
some 1
attention 1
to 1
the 1
doubts 1
and 1
difficulties 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
homeric 1
question 1
is 1
beset 1
and 1
to 1
entreat 1
our 1
reader 1
for 1
a 1
brief 1
period 1
to 1
prefer 1
his 1
judgment 1
to 1
his 1
imagination 1

of 1

my 1
sympathy 1

the 1

think 1

of 1
its 1
unity 1
by 1

of 1

was 1
not 1
till 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
the 1
grammarians 1
that 1
its 1
primitive 1
integrity 1
was 1
called 1
in 1
question 1
nor 1
is 1
it 1
injustice 1
to 1
assert 1
that 1
the 1
minute 1
and 1
analytical 1
spirit 1
of 1
a 1
grammarian 1
is 1
not 1
the 1
best 1
qualification 1
for 1
the 1

on 1
the 1
subject 1

us 1
now 1
see 1
what 1
are 1
the 1
discoveries 1
to 1
which 1
more 1
modern 1
investigations 1
lay 1
claim 1
at 1
the 1
end 1
of 1
the 1
seventeenth 1
century 1
doubts 1
had 1
begun 1
to 1
awaken 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
and 1
we 1
find 1
bentley 1
remarking 1
that 1
homer 1
wrote 1
a 1
sequel 1
of 1
songs 1
and 1
rhapsodies 1
to 1
be 1
sung 1
by 1
himself 1
for 1
small 1
comings 1
and 1
good 1
cheer 1
at 1
festivals 1
and 1
other 1
days 1
of 1
merriment 1
these 1
loose 1
songs 1
were 1
not 1
collected 1
together 1
in 1
the 1
form 1
of 1
an 1
epic 1
poem 1
till 1
about 1
peisistratus 1

five 1
hundred 1

french 1
writershedelin 1
and 1

a 1
similar 1
scepticism 1
on 1
the 1
subject 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
scienza 1
nuova 1
of 1
battista 1
vico 1
that 1
we 1
first 1
meet 1
with 1
the 1
germ 1
of 1
the 1
theory 1
subsequently 1
defended 1
by 1
wolf 1
with 1
so 1
much 1
learning 1
and 1
acuteness 1
indeed 1
it 1
is 1
with 1
the 1
wolfian 1
theory 1
that 1
we 1
have 1
chiefly 1
to 1
deal 1
and 1
with 1
the 1
following 1
bold 1
hypothesis 1
which 1
we 1
will 1
detail 1
in 1
the 1
words 1
of 1
grote 1
half 1
a 1
century 1
ago 1
the 1
acute 1
and 1
valuable 1
prolegomena 1
of 1

to 1
account 1
the 1
venetian 1
scholia 1
which 1

then 1
been 1
recently 1

opened 1
philosophical 1
discussion 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
text 1
a 1
considerable 1
part 1
of 1
that 1
dissertation 1
though 1
by 1
no 1
means 1
the 1
whole 1
is 1
employed 1
in 1
vindicating 1
the 1
position 1
previously 1
announced 1
by 1
bentley 1
amongst 1
others 1
that 1
the 1
separate 1
constituent 1
portions 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
cemented 1
together 1
into 1
any 1
compact 1
body 1
and 1
unchangeable 1
order 1
until 1
the 1
days 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
in 1
the 1
sixth 1
century 1
before 1
christ 1
as 1
a 1
step 1
towards 1
that 1
conclusion 1
wolf 1
maintained 1
that 1
no 1
written 1
copies 1
of 1
either 1
poem 1
could 1
be 1
shown 1
to 1
have 1
existed 1
during 1
the 1
earlier 1
times 1
to 1
which 1
their 1
composition 1
is 1
referred 1
and 1
that 1
without 1
writing 1
neither 1
the 1
perfect 1
symmetry 1
of 1
so 1
complicated 1
a 1
work 1
could 1
have 1
been 1
originally 1
conceived 1
by 1
any 1
poet 1
nor 1
if 1
realized 1
by 1
him 1
transmitted 1
with 1
assurance 1
to 1
posterity 1
the 1
absence 1
of 1
easy 1
and 1
convenient 1
writing 1
such 1
as 1
must 1
be 1
indispensably 1
supposed 1
for 1
long 1
manuscripts 1
among 1
the 1
early 1
greeks 1
was 1
thus 1
one 1
of 1
the 1
points 1
in 1
wolfs 1
case 1
against 1
the 1
primitive 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
by 1
nitzsch 1
and 1
other 1
leading 1
opponents 1
of 1
wolf 1
the 1
connection 1
of 1
the 1
one 1
with 1
the 1
other 1
seems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
accepted 1
as 1
he 1
originally 1
put 1
it 1
and 1
it 1
has 1
been 1
considered 1
incumbent 1
on 1
those 1
who 1
defended 1
the 1
ancient 1
aggregate 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
to 1
maintain 1
that 1
they 1
were 1
written 1
poems 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
to 1
me 1
it 1
appears 1
that 1
the 1
architectonic 1
functions 1
ascribed 1
by 1
wolf 1
to 1
peisistratus 1
and 1
his 1
associates 1
in 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
homeric 1
poems 1
are 1
nowise 1
admissible 1
but 1
much 1
would 1
undoubtedly 1
be 1
gained 1
towards 1
that 1
view 1
of 1
the 1
question 1
if 1
it 1
could 1
be 1
shown 1
that 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
controvert 1
it 1
we 1
were 1
driven 1
to 1
the 1
necessity 1
of 1
admitting 1
long 1
written 1
poems 1
in 1
the 1
ninth 1
century 1
before 1
the 1
christian 1
aera 1
few 1
things 1
in 1
my 1
opinion 1
can 1
be 1
more 1
improbable 1
and 1
mr 1
payne 1
knight 1
opposed 1
as 1
he 1
is 1
to 1
the 1
wolfian 1
hypothesis 1
admits 1
this 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
wolf 1
himself 1
the 1
traces 1
of 1
writing 1
in 1
greece 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
seventh 1
century 1
before 1
the 1
christian 1
aera 1
are 1
exceedingly 1
trifling 1
we 1
have 1
no 1
remaining 1
inscription 1
earlier 1
than 1
the 1
fortieth 1
olympiad 1
and 1
the 1
early 1
inscriptions 1
are 1
rude 1
and 1
unskilfully 1
executed 1
nor 1
can 1
we 1
even 1
assure 1
ourselves 1
whether 1
archilochus 1
simonides 1
of 1
amorgus 1
kallinus 1
tyrtaeus 1
xanthus 1
and 1
the 1
other 1
early 1
elegiac 1
and 1
lyric 1
poets 1
committed 1
their 1
compositions 1
to 1
writing 1
or 1
at 1
what 1
time 1
the 1
practice 1
of 1
doing 1
so 1
became 1
familiar 1
the 1
first 1
positive 1
ground 1
which 1
authorizes 1
us 1
to 1
presume 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
a 1
manuscript 1
of 1
homer 1
is 1
in 1
the 1
famous 1
ordinance 1
of 1
solon 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
the 1
rhapsodies 1
at 1
the 1
panathenaea 1
but 1
for 1
what 1
length 1
of 1
time 1
previously 1
manuscripts 1
had 1
existed 1
we 1
are 1
unable 1
to 1
say 1
those 1
who 1
maintain 1
the 1
homeric 1
poems 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
written 1
from 1
the 1
beginning 1
rest 1
their 1
case 1
not 1
upon 1
positive 1
proofs 1
nor 1
yet 1
upon 1
the 1
existing 1
habits 1
of 1
society 1
with 1
regard 1
to 1
poetryfor 1
they 1
admit 1
generally 1
that 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
were 1
not 1
read 1
but 1
recited 1
and 1
heardbut 1
upon 1
the 1
supposed 1
necessity 1
that 1
there 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
manuscripts 1
to 1
ensure 1
the 1
preservation 1
of 1
the 1
poemsthe 1
unassisted 1
memory 1
of 1
reciters 1
being 1
neither 1
sufficient 1
nor 1
trustworthy 1
but 1
here 1
we 1
only 1
escape 1
a 1
smaller 1
difficulty 1
by 1
running 1
into 1
a 1
greater 1
for 1
the 1
existence 1
of 1
trained 1
bards 1
gifted 1
with 1
extraordinary 1
memory 1
is 1
far 1
less 1
astonishing 1
than 1
that 1
of 1
long 1
manuscripts 1
in 1
an 1
age 1
essentially 1
nonreading 1
and 1
nonwriting 1
and 1
when 1
even 1
suitable 1
instruments 1
and 1
materials 1
for 1
the 1
process 1
are 1
not 1
obvious 1
moreover 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
strong 1
positive 1
reason 1
for 1
believing 1
that 1
the 1
bard 1
was 1
under 1
no 1
necessity 1
of 1
refreshing 1
his 1
memory 1
by 1
consulting 1
a 1
manuscript 1
for 1
if 1
such 1
had 1
been 1
the 1
fact 1
blindness 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
a 1
disqualification 1
for 1
the 1
profession 1
which 1
we 1
know 1
that 1
it 1
was 1
not 1
as 1
well 1
from 1
the 1
example 1
of 1
demodokus 1
in 1
the 1
odyssey 1
as 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
blind 1
bard 1
of 1
chios 1
in 1
the 1
hymn 1
to 1
the 1
delian 1
apollo 1
whom 1
thucydides 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
the 1
general 1
tenor 1
of 1
grecian 1
legend 1
identifies 1
with 1
homer 1
himself 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
that 1
hymn 1
be 1
he 1
who 1
he 1
may 1
could 1
never 1
have 1
described 1
a 1
blind 1
man 1
as 1
attaining 1
the 1
utmost 1
perfection 1
in 1
his 1
art 1
if 1
he 1
had 1
been 1
conscious 1
that 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
bard 1
was 1
only 1
maintained 1
by 1
constant 1
reference 1
to 1
the 1
manuscript 1
in 1
his 1
chest 1
the 1
loss 1
of 1
the 1
digamma 1
that 1
crux 1
of 1
critics 1
that 1
quicksand 1
upon 1
which 1
even 1
the 1
acumen 1
of 1
bentley 1
was 1
shipwrecked 1
seems 1
to 1
prove 1
beyond 1
a 1
doubt 1
that 1
the 1
pronunciation 1
of 1
the 1
greek 1
language 1
had 1
undergone 1
a 1
considerable 1
change 1
now 1
it 1
is 1
certainly 1
difficult 1
to 1
suppose 1
that 1
the 1
homeric 1
poems 1
could 1
have 1
suffered 1
by 1
this 1
change 1
had 1
written 1
copies 1
been 1
preserved 1
if 1
chaucers 1
poetry 1
for 1
instance 1
had 1
not 1
been 1
written 1
it 1
could 1
only 1
have 1
come 1
down 1
to 1
us 1

planted 1

also 1
interwoven 1
with 1
the 1
feelings 1

conceived 1

all 1
those 1

with 1
its 1
accompaniments 1
of 1
a 1
solemn 1

festival 1
the 1
only 1
persons 1

a 1

emotions 1
which 1
they 1
had 1
experienced 1

who 1
would 1
on 1
perusing 1
the 1

a 1
sensible 1
portion 1
of 1

as 1
the 1

in 1
an 1
age 1

the 1
present 1
there 1
is 1
in 1

there 1
was 1
in 1
early 1
greece 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
no 1
such 1

existed 1
if 1
we 1

at 1
what 1
time 1
such 1
a 1

first 1
began 1

formed 1
we 1
should 1
be 1
able 1
to 1
make 1
a 1
guess 1
at 1
the 1
time 1
when 1
the 1
old 1
epic 1
poems 1
were 1
first 1
committed 1
to 1
writing 1
now 1
the 1
period 1
which 1
may 1
with 1
the 1
greatest 1
probability 1
be 1
fixed 1
upon 1
as 1
having 1
first 1
witnessed 1
the 1
formation 1
even 1
of 1
the 1
narrowest 1
reading 1
class 1
in 1
greece 1
is 1
the 1
middle 1
of 1
the 1
seventh 1
century 1
before 1

age 1
of 1
terpander 1
kallinus 1
archilochus 1
simenides 1
of 1
amorgus 1
c 1
i 1
ground 1
this 1
supposition 1
on 1
the 1
change 1
then 1
operated 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
and 1
tendencies 1
of 1
grecian 1
poetry 1
and 1
musicthe 1
elegiac 1
and 1
the 1
iambic 1
measures 1
having 1
been 1
introduced 1
as 1
rivals 1
to 1
the 1
primitive 1
hexameter 1
and 1
poetical 1
compositions 1
having 1
been 1
transferred 1
from 1
the 1
epical 1
past 1
to 1
the 1
affairs 1
of 1
present 1
and 1
real 1
life 1
such 1
a 1
change 1
was 1
important 1
at 1
a 1
time 1
when 1
poetry 1
was 1
the 1
only 1
known 1
mode 1
of 1
publication 1
to 1
use 1
a 1
modern 1
phrase 1
not 1
altogether 1
suitable 1
yet 1
the 1
nearest 1
approaching 1
to 1
the 1
sense 1
it 1
argued 1
a 1
new 1
way 1
of 1
looking 1
at 1
the 1
old 1
epical 1
treasures 1
of 1
the 1
people 1
as 1
well 1
as 1
a 1
thirst 1
for 1
new 1
poetical 1
effect 1
and 1
the 1
men 1
who 1
stood 1
forward 1
in 1
it 1
may 1
well 1
be 1
considered 1
as 1
desirous 1
to 1
study 1
and 1
competent 1
to 1
criticize 1
from 1
their 1
own 1
individual 1
point 1
of 1
view 1
the 1
written 1
words 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
rhapsodies 1
just 1
as 1
we 1
are 1
told 1
that 1
kallinus 1
both 1
noticed 1
and 1
eulogized 1
the 1
thebais 1
as 1
the 1
production 1
of 1
homer 1

seems 1
therefore 1
ground 1
for 1
conjecturing 1
that 1

of 1

towards 1
the 1

the 1

of 1
egypt 1
to 1
grecian 1
commerce 1
which 1
took 1
place 1
about 1
the 1

period 1
would 1
furnish 1
increased 1
facilities 1
for 1
obtaining 1
the 1
requisite 1
papyrus 1
to 1
write 1
upon 1
a 1
reading 1
class 1
when 1
once 1
formed 1
would 1
doubtless 1
slowly 1
increase 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
manuscripts 1
along 1
with 1
it 1
so 1
that 1
before 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
solon 1
fifty 1
years 1
afterwards 1
both 1
readers 1
and 1
manuscripts 1
though 1
still 1
comparatively 1
few 1
might 1
have 1
attained 1
a 1
certain 1
recognized 1
authority 1
and 1
formed 1
a 1
tribunal 1
of 1
reference 1
against 1
the 1
carelessness 1
of 1
individual 1
rhapsodies 1
but 1
even 1
peisistratus 1
has 1
not 1
been 1
suffered 1
to 1
remain 1
in 1
possession 1
of 1
the 1
credit 1
and 1
we 1
cannot 1
help 1
feeling 1
the 1
force 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
observations 1
there 1
are 1
several 1
incidental 1
circumstances 1
which 1
in 1
our 1
opinion 1
throw 1
some 1
suspicion 1
over 1
the 1
whole 1
history 1
of 1
the 1
peisistratid 1
compilation 1
at 1
least 1
over 1
the 1
theory 1
that 1
the 1
iliad 1
was 1
cast 1
into 1
its 1
present 1
stately 1
and 1
harmonious 1
form 1
by 1
the 1
directions 1
of 1
the 1
athenian 1
ruler 1
if 1
the 1
great 1
poets 1
who 1
flourished 1
at 1
the 1
bright 1
period 1
of 1
grecian 1
song 1
of 1
which 1
alas 1
we 1
have 1
inherited 1
little 1
more 1
than 1
the 1
fame 1
and 1
the 1
faint 1
echo 1
if 1
stesichorus 1
anacreon 1
and 1
simonides 1
were 1
employed 1
in 1
the 1
noble 1
task 1
of 1
compiling 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
so 1
much 1
must 1
have 1
been 1
done 1
to 1
arrange 1
to 1
connect 1
to 1
harmonize 1
that 1
it 1
is 1
almost 1
incredible 1
that 1
stronger 1
marks 1
of 1
athenian 1
manufacture 1
should 1
not 1
remain 1
whatever 1
occasional 1
anomalies 1
may 1
be 1
detected 1
anomalies 1
which 1
no 1
doubt 1
arise 1
out 1
of 1
our 1
own 1
ignorance 1
of 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
age 1
however 1
the 1
irregular 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
digamma 1
may 1
have 1
perplexed 1
our 1
bentleys 1
to 1
whom 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
helen 1
is 1
said 1
to 1
have 1
caused 1
as 1
much 1
disquiet 1
and 1
distress 1
as 1
the 1
fair 1
one 1
herself 1
among 1
the 1
heroes 1
of 1
her 1
age 1
however 1
mr 1
knight 1
may 1
have 1
failed 1
in 1
reducing 1
the 1
homeric 1
language 1
to 1
its 1
primitive 1
form 1
however 1
finally 1
the 1
attic 1
dialect 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
assumed 1
all 1
its 1
more 1
marked 1
and 1
distinguishing 1
characteristicsstill 1
it 1
is 1
difficult 1
to 1
suppose 1
that 1
the 1
language 1
particularly 1
in 1
the 1
joinings 1
and 1
transitions 1
and 1
connecting 1
parts 1
should 1
not 1
more 1
clearly 1
betray 1
the 1
incongruity 1
between 1
the 1
more 1
ancient 1
and 1
modern 1
forms 1
of 1
expression 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
quite 1
in 1
character 1
with 1
such 1
a 1
period 1
to 1
imitate 1
an 1
antique 1
style 1
in 1
order 1
to 1
piece 1
out 1
an 1
imperfect 1
poem 1
in 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
original 1
as 1
sir 1
walter 1
scott 1
has 1
done 1
in 1
his 1
continuation 1
of 1
sir 1
tristram 1
if 1
however 1
not 1
even 1
such 1
faint 1
and 1
indistinct 1
traces 1
of 1
athenian 1
compilation 1
are 1
discoverable 1
in 1
the 1
language 1
of 1
the 1
poems 1
the 1
total 1
absence 1
of 1
athenian 1
national 1
feeling 1
is 1
perhaps 1
no 1
less 1
worthy 1
of 1
observation 1
in 1
later 1
and 1
it 1
may 1
fairly 1
be 1
suspected 1
in 1
earlier 1
times 1
the 1
athenians 1
were 1
more 1
than 1
ordinarily 1
jealous 1
of 1
the 1
fame 1
of 1
their 1
ancestors 1
but 1
amid 1
all 1
the 1
traditions 1
of 1
the 1
glories 1
of 1
early 1
greece 1
embodied 1
in 1
the 1
iliad 1
the 1
athenians 1
play 1
a 1
most 1
subordinate 1
and 1
insignificant 1
part 1
even 1
the 1
few 1
passages 1
which 1
relate 1
to 1
their 1
ancestors 1
mr 1
knight 1
suspects 1
to 1
be 1
interpolations 1
it 1
is 1
possible 1
indeed 1
that 1
in 1
its 1
leading 1
outline 1
the 1
iliad 1
may 1
be 1
true 1
to 1
historic 1
fact 1
that 1
in 1
the 1
great 1
maritime 1
expedition 1
of 1
western 1
greece 1
against 1
the 1
rival 1
and 1
halfkindred 1
empire 1
of 1
the 1
laomedontiadae 1
the 1
chieftain 1
of 1
thessaly 1
from 1
his 1
valour 1
and 1
the 1
number 1
of 1
his 1
forces 1
may 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
ally 1
of 1
the 1
peloponnesian 1
sovereign 1
the 1
preeminent 1
value 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
poetry 1
on 1
the 1
trojan 1
war 1
may 1
thus 1
have 1
forced 1
the 1
national 1
feeling 1
of 1
the 1
athenians 1
to 1
yield 1
to 1
their 1
taste 1
the 1
songs 1
which 1
spoke 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
great 1
ancestor 1
were 1
no 1
doubt 1
of 1
far 1
inferior 1
sublimity 1
and 1
popularity 1
or 1
at 1
first 1
sight 1
a 1
theseid 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
much 1
more 1
likely 1
to 1
have 1
emanated 1
from 1
an 1
athenian 1
synod 1
of 1
compilers 1
of 1
ancient 1
song 1
than 1
an 1
achilleid 1
or 1
an 1
odysseid 1
could 1
france 1
have 1
given 1
birth 1
to 1
a 1
tasso 1
tancred 1
would 1
have 1
been 1
the 1
hero 1
of 1
the 1
jerusalem 1
if 1
however 1
the 1
homeric 1
ballads 1
as 1
they 1
are 1
sometimes 1
called 1
which 1
related 1
the 1
wrath 1
of 1
achilles 1
with 1
all 1
its 1
direful 1
consequences 1
were 1
so 1
far 1
superior 1
to 1
the 1
rest 1
of 1
the 1
poetic 1
cycle 1
as 1
to 1
admit 1
no 1
rivalryit 1
is 1
still 1
surprising 1
that 1
throughout 1
the 1
whole 1
poem 1
the 1
callida 1
junctura 1
should 1
never 1
betray 1
the 1
workmanship 1
of 1
an 1
athenian 1
hand 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
national 1
spirit 1
of 1
a 1
race 1
who 1
have 1
at 1
a 1
later 1
period 1
not 1
inaptly 1
been 1
compared 1
to 1
our 1
selfadmiring 1
neighbours 1
the 1
french 1
should 1
submit 1
with 1
lofty 1
selfdenial 1
to 1
the 1
almost 1
total 1
exclusion 1
of 1
their 1
own 1
ancestorsor 1
at 1
least 1
to 1
the 1
questionable 1
dignity 1
of 1
only 1
having 1
produced 1
a 1
leader 1
tolerably 1
skilled 1
in 1
the 1
military 1
tactics 1
of 1
his 1
age 1
to 1
return 1
to 1
the 1
wolfian 1
theory 1
while 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
be 1
confessed 1
that 1
wolfs 1
objections 1
to 1
the 1
primitive 1
integrity 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
have 1
never 1
been 1
wholly 1
got 1
over 1
we 1
cannot 1
help 1
discovering 1
that 1
they 1
have 1
failed 1
to 1
enlighten 1
us 1
as 1
to 1
any 1
substantial 1
point 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
difficulties 1
with 1
which 1
the 1
whole 1
subject 1
is 1
beset 1
are 1
rather 1
augmented 1
than 1
otherwise 1
if 1
we 1
admit 1
his 1
hypothesis 1
nor 1
is 1
lachmanns 1
modification 1
of 1
his 1
theory 1
any 1
better 1
he 1
divides 1
the 1
first 1
twentytwo 1
books 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
into 1
sixteen 1
different 1
songs 1
and 1
treats 1
as 1
ridiculous 1
the 1
belief 1
that 1
their 1
amalgamation 1
into 1
one 1
regular 1
poem 1
belongs 1
to 1
a 1
period 1
earlier 1
than 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
this 1
as 1
grote 1
observes 1
explains 1
the 1
gaps 1
and 1
contradictions 1
in 1
the 1
narrative 1
but 1
it 1
explains 1
nothing 1
else 1
moreover 1
we 1
find 1
no 1
contradictions 1
warranting 1
this 1
belief 1
and 1
the 1
socalled 1
sixteen 1
poets 1
concur 1
in 1
getting 1
rid 1
of 1
the 1
following 1
leading 1
men 1
in 1
the 1
first 1
battle 1
after 1
the 1
secession 1
of 1

of 1
these 1

again 1
make 1
their 1
appearance 1
and 1
we 1
can 1
but 1
agree 1
with 1
colonel 1
mure 1
that 1
it 1
seems 1
strange 1
that 1
any 1
number 1
of 1
independent 1
poets 1
should 1
have 1
so 1
harmoniously 1
dispensed 1
with 1
the 1
services 1
of 1
all 1
six 1
in 1
the 1

only 1
be 1
regarded 1
as 1
the 1
result 1
of 1
an 1
interpolation 1
grote 1
although 1
not 1
very 1
distinct 1
in 1
stating 1
his 1
own 1
opinions 1
on 1
the 1

done 1
much 1
to 1
clearly 1
show 1
the 1
incongruity 1
of 1
the 1
wolfian 1
theory 1
and 1
of 1
lachmanns 1
modifications 1
with 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
but 1
he 1
has 1
also 1
shown 1
and 1
we 1
think 1
with 1
equal 1
success 1
that 1
the 1
two 1
questions 1
relative 1
to 1
the 1
primitive 1
unity 1
of 1
these 1
poems 1

supposing 1
that 1
impossible 1
the 1
unison 1
of 1
these 1
parts 1
by 1
peisistratus 1
and 1
not 1
before 1
his 1
time 1
are 1
essentially 1
distinct 1
in 1
short 1
a 1
man 1
may 1
believe 1
the 1
iliad 1
to 1
have 1
been 1
put 1
together 1
out 1
of 1
preexisting 1
songs 1
without 1
recognising 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
as 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
its 1
first 1
compilation 1
the 1
friends 1
or 1
literary 1
employes 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
must 1
have 1
found 1
an 1
iliad 1
that 1
was 1
already 1
ancient 1
and 1
the 1
silence 1
of 1
the 1
alexandrine 1
critics 1
respecting 1
the 1
peisistratic 1
recension 1
goes 1
far 1
to 1
prove 1
that 1
among 1
the 1
numerous 1
manuscripts 1
they 1
examined 1
this 1
was 1
either 1
wanting 1
or 1
thought 1
unworthy 1
of 1
attention 1
moreover 1
he 1
continues 1
the 1
whole 1
tenor 1
of 1
the 1
poems 1
themselves 1
confirms 1
what 1
is 1
here 1
remarked 1
there 1
is 1
nothing 1
either 1
in 1
the 1
iliad 1
or 1
odyssey 1
which 1
savours 1
of 1
modernism 1
applying 1
that 1
term 1
to 1
the 1
age 1
of 1
peisistratusnothing 1
which 1
brings 1
to 1
our 1
view 1
the 1
alterations 1
brought 1
about 1
by 1
two 1
centuries 1
in 1
the 1
greek 1
language 1

onomakritus 1

the 1

of 1

could 1
hardly 1
have 1
failed 1
to 1
notice 1
even 1
without 1

had 1
they 1
then 1
for 1
the 1

in 1

to 1
an 1
age 1
two 1

three 1
centuries 1
earlier 1
than 1
peisistratus 1
indeed 1
even 1
the 1
interpolations 1

those 1
passages 1
which 1
on 1
the 1
best 1
grounds 1
are 1
pronounced 1
to 1
be 1
such 1

no 1

the 1

well 1
internal 1
as 1

enable 1
us 1
to 1
judge 1
we 1
seem 1
warranted 1
in 1
believing 1
that 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
were 1
recited 1
substantially 1
as 1
they 1
now 1
stand 1
always 1
allowing 1
for 1
partial 1
divergences 1
of 1

interpolations 1
in 1

our 1
first 1

this 1
ancient 1
date 1
let 1
it 1
be 1
added 1
as 1
it 1
is 1
the 1
bestauthenticated 1
fact 1
so 1
it 1
is 1
also 1
the 1
most 1
important 1
attribute 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
poems 1
considered 1
in 1
reference 1
to 1
grecian 1
history 1
for 1
they 1
thus 1
afford 1
us 1
an 1
insight 1
into 1
the 1
antihistorical 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
greeks 1
enabling 1
us 1
to 1
trace 1
the 1
subsequent 1
forward 1
march 1
of 1
the 1
nation 1
and 1
to 1
seize 1
instructive 1
contrasts 1
between 1
their 1
former 1
and 1
their 1
later 1
condition 1
on 1
the 1
whole 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
believe 1
that 1
the 1
labours 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
were 1
wholly 1
of 1
an 1
editorial 1
character 1
although 1
i 1
must 1
confess 1
that 1
i 1
can 1
lay 1
down 1
nothing 1
respecting 1
the 1
extent 1
of 1
his 1
labours 1
at 1
the 1
same 1
time 1
so 1
far 1
from 1
believing 1
that 1
the 1
composition 1
or 1
primary 1
arrangement 1
of 1
these 1
poems 1
in 1
their 1
present 1
form 1
was 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
i 1
am 1
rather 1
persuaded 1
that 1
the 1
fine 1
taste 1
and 1
elegant 1
mind 1
of 1
that 1
athenian 1
would 1
lead 1
him 1
to 1
preserve 1
an 1
ancient 1
and 1
traditional 1
order 1
of 1
the 1
poems 1
rather 1
than 1
to 1
patch 1
and 1
reconstruct 1
them 1
according 1
to 1
a 1
fanciful 1
hypothesis 1
i 1
will 1
not 1
repeat 1
the 1
many 1
discussions 1
respecting 1
whether 1
the 1
poems 1
were 1
written 1
or 1
not 1
or 1
whether 1
the 1
art 1
of 1
writing 1
was 1
known 1
in 1
the 1
time 1
of 1
their 1
reputed 1
author 1
suffice 1
it 1
to 1
say 1
that 1
the 1
more 1
we 1
read 1
the 1
less 1
satisfied 1
we 1
are 1
upon 1
either 1
subject 1
i 1
cannot 1
however 1
help 1
thinking 1
that 1
the 1
story 1
which 1
attributes 1
the 1
preservation 1
of 1
these 1
poems 1
to 1
lycurgus 1
is 1
little 1
else 1
than 1
a 1
version 1
of 1
the 1
same 1
story 1
as 1
that 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
while 1
its 1
historical 1
probability 1
must 1
be 1
measured 1
by 1
that 1
of 1
many 1
others 1
relating 1
to 1
the 1
spartan 1
confucius 1
i 1
will 1
conclude 1
this 1
sketch 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
theories 1
with 1
an 1
attempt 1
made 1
by 1
an 1
ingenious 1
friend 1
to 1
unite 1
them 1
into 1
something 1
like 1
consistency 1
it 1
is 1
as 1
follows 1
no 1
doubt 1
the 1
common 1
soldiers 1
of 1
that 1
age 1
had 1
like 1
the 1
common 1
sailors 1
of 1
some 1
fifty 1
years 1
ago 1
some 1
one 1
qualified 1
to 1
discourse 1
in 1
excellent 1
music 1
among 1
them 1
many 1
of 1
these 1
like 1
those 1
of 1
the 1
negroes 1
in 1
the 1
united 1
states 1
were 1
extemporaneous 1
and 1
allusive 1
to 1
events 1
passing 1
around 1
them 1
but 1
what 1
was 1
passing 1
around 1
them 1
the 1
grand 1
events 1
of 1
a 1
spiritstirring 1
war 1
occurrences 1
likely 1
to 1
impress 1
themselves 1
as 1
the 1
mystical 1
legends 1
of 1
former 1
times 1
had 1
done 1
upon 1
their 1
memory 1
besides 1
which 1
a 1
retentive 1
memory 1
was 1
deemed 1
a 1
virtue 1
of 1
the 1
first 1
water 1
and 1
was 1
cultivated 1
accordingly 1
in 1
those 1
ancient 1
times 1
ballads 1
at 1
first 1
and 1
down 1
to 1
the 1
beginning 1
of 1
the 1
war 1
with 1
troy 1
were 1
merely 1
recitations 1
with 1
an 1
intonation 1
then 1
followed 1
a 1
species 1
of 1
recitative 1
probably 1
with 1
an 1
intoned 1
burden 1
tune 1
next 1
followed 1
as 1
it 1
aided 1
the 1
memory 1
considerably 1
it 1
was 1
at 1
this 1
period 1
about 1
four 1
hundred 1
years 1
after 1
the 1
war 1
that 1
a 1
poet 1
flourished 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
of 1
melesigenes 1
or 1
moeonides 1
but 1
most 1
probably 1
the 1
former 1
he 1
saw 1
that 1
these 1
ballads 1
might 1
be 1
made 1
of 1
great 1
utility 1
to 1
his 1
purpose 1
of 1
writing 1
a 1
poem 1
on 1
the 1
social 1
position 1
of 1
hellas 1
and 1
as 1
a 1
collection 1
he 1
published 1
these 1
lays 1
connecting 1
them 1
by 1
a 1
tale 1
of 1
his 1
own 1
this 1
poem 1
now 1
exists 1
under 1
the 1
title 1
of 1
the 1
odyssea 1
the 1
author 1
however 1
did 1
not 1
affix 1
his 1
own 1
name 1
to 1
the 1
poem 1
which 1
in 1
fact 1
was 1
great 1
part 1
of 1
it 1
remodelled 1
from 1
the 1
archaic 1
dialect 1
of 1
crete 1
in 1
which 1
tongue 1
the 1
ballads 1
were 1
found 1
by 1
him 1
he 1
therefore 1
called 1
it 1
the 1
poem 1
of 1
homeros 1
or 1
the 1
collector 1
but 1
this 1
is 1
rather 1
a 1
proof 1
of 1
his 1
modesty 1
and 1
talent 1
than 1
of 1
his 1
mere 1
drudging 1
arrangement 1
of 1
other 1
peoples 1
ideas 1
for 1
as 1
grote 1
has 1
finely 1
observed 1
arguing 1
for 1
the 1
unity 1
of 1
authorship 1
a 1
great 1
poet 1
might 1
have 1
recast 1
preexisting 1
separate 1
songs 1
into 1
one 1
comprehensive 1
whole 1
but 1
no 1
mere 1
arrangers 1
or 1
compilers 1
would 1
be 1
competent 1
to 1
do 1
so 1
while 1
employed 1
on 1
the 1
wild 1
legend 1
of 1
odysseus 1
he 1
met 1
with 1
a 1
ballad 1
recording 1
the 1
quarrel 1
of 1
achilles 1
and 1
agamemnon 1
his 1
noble 1
mind 1
seized 1
the 1
hint 1
that 1
there 1
presented 1
itself 1
and 1
the 1
achilleis 1
grew 1
under 1
his 1
hand 1
unity 1
of 1
design 1
however 1
caused 1
him 1
to 1
publish 1
the 1
poem 1
under 1
the 1
same 1
pseudonyme 1
as 1
his 1
former 1
work 1
and 1
the 1
disjointed 1
lays 1
of 1
the 1
ancient 1
bards 1
were 1
joined 1
together 1
like 1
those 1
relating 1
to 1
the 1
cid 1
into 1
a 1
chronicle 1
history 1
named 1
the 1
iliad 1
melesigenes 1
knew 1
that 1
the 1
poem 1
was 1
destined 1
to 1
be 1
a 1
lasting 1
one 1
and 1
so 1
it 1
has 1
proved 1
but 1
first 1
the 1
poems 1
were 1
destined 1
to 1
undergo 1
many 1
vicissitudes 1
and 1
corruptions 1
by 1
the 1
people 1
who 1
took 1
to 1
singing 1
them 1
in 1
the 1
streets 1
assemblies 1
and 1
agoras 1
however 1
solon 1
first 1
and 1
then 1
peisistratus 1
and 1
afterwards 1
aristoteles 1
and 1
others 1
revised 1
the 1
poems 1
and 1
restored 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
melesigenes 1
homeros 1
to 1
their 1
original 1
integrity 1
in 1
a 1
great 1
measure 1
having 1
thus 1
given 1
some 1
general 1
notion 1
of 1
the 1
strange 1
theories 1
which 1
have 1
developed 1
themselves 1
respecting 1
this 1
most 1
interesting 1
subject 1
i 1
must 1
still 1
express 1
my 1
conviction 1
as 1
to 1
the 1
unity 1
of 1
the 1
authorship 1
of 1
the 1
homeric 1
poems 1
to 1
deny 1
that 1
many 1
corruptions 1
and 1
interpolations 1
disfigure 1
them 1
and 1
that 1
the 1
intrusive 1
hand 1
of 1
the 1
poetasters 1
may 1
here 1
and 1
there 1
have 1
inflicted 1
a 1
wound 1
more 1
serious 1
than 1
the 1
negligence 1
of 1
the 1
copyist 1
would 1
be 1
an 1
absurd 1
and 1
captious 1
assumption 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
to 1
a 1
higher 1
criticism 1
that 1
we 1
must 1
appeal 1
if 1
we 1
would 1
either 1
understand 1
or 1
enjoy 1
these 1
poems 1
in 1
maintaining 1
the 1
authenticity 1
and 1
personality 1
of 1
their 1
one 1
author 1
be 1
he 1
homer 1
or 1
melesigenes 1
quocunque 1
nomine 1
vocari 1
eum 1
jus 1
fasque 1
sit 1
i 1
feel 1
conscious 1
that 1
while 1
the 1
whole 1
weight 1
of 1
historical 1
evidence 1
is 1
against 1
the 1
hypothesis 1
which 1
would 1
assign 1
these 1
great 1
works 1
to 1
a 1
plurality 1
of 1
authors 1
the 1
most 1
powerful 1
internal 1
evidence 1
and 1
that 1
which 1
springs 1
from 1
the 1
deepest 1
and 1
most 1
immediate 1
impulse 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
also 1
speaks 1
eloquently 1
to 1
the 1
contrary 1
the 1
minutiae 1
of 1
verbal 1
criticism 1
i 1
am 1
far 1
from 1
seeking 1
to 1
despise 1
indeed 1
considering 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
some 1
of 1
my 1
own 1
books 1
such 1
an 1
attempt 1
would 1
be 1
gross 1
inconsistency 1
but 1
while 1
i 1
appreciate 1
its 1
importance 1
in 1
a 1
philological 1
view 1
i 1
am 1
inclined 1
to 1
set 1
little 1
store 1
on 1
its 1
aesthetic 1
value 1
especially 1
in 1
poetry 1
three 1
parts 1
of 1
the 1
emendations 1
made 1
upon 1
poets 1
are 1
mere 1
alterations 1
some 1
of 1
which 1
had 1
they 1
been 1
suggested 1
to 1
the 1
author 1
by 1
his 1
maecenas 1
or 1
africanus 1
he 1
would 1
probably 1
have 1
adopted 1
moreover 1
those 1
who 1
are 1
most 1
exact 1
in 1
laying 1
down 1
rules 1
of 1
verbal 1
criticism 1
and 1
interpretation 1
are 1
often 1
least 1
competent 1
to 1
carry 1
out 1
their 1
own 1
precepts 1
grammarians 1
are 1
not 1
poets 1
by 1
profession 1
but 1
may 1
be 1
so 1
per 1
accidens 1
i 1
do 1
not 1
at 1
this 1
moment 1
remember 1
two 1
emendations 1
on 1
homer 1
calculated 1
to 1
substantially 1
improve 1
the 1
poetry 1
of 1
a 1
passage 1
although 1
a 1
mass 1
of 1
remarks 1
from 1
herodotus 1
down 1
to 1
loewe 1
have 1
given 1
us 1
the 1
history 1
of 1
a 1
thousand 1
minute 1
points 1
without 1
which 1
our 1
greek 1
knowledge 1
would 1
be 1
gloomy 1
and 1
jejune 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
not 1
on 1
words 1
only 1
that 1
grammarians 1
mere 1
grammarians 1
will 1
exercise 1
their 1
elaborate 1
and 1
often 1
tiresome 1
ingenuity 1
binding 1
down 1
an 1
heroic 1
or 1
dramatic 1
poet 1
to 1
the 1
block 1
upon 1
which 1
they 1
have 1
previously 1
dissected 1
his 1
words 1
and 1
sentences 1
they 1
proceed 1
to 1
use 1
the 1
axe 1
and 1
the 1
pruning 1
knife 1
by 1
wholesale 1
and 1
inconsistent 1
in 1
everything 1
but 1
their 1
wish 1
to 1
make 1
out 1
a 1
case 1
of 1
unlawful 1
affiliation 1
they 1
cut 1
out 1
book 1
after 1
book 1
passage 1
after 1
passage 1
till 1
the 1
author 1
is 1
reduced 1
to 1
a 1
collection 1
of 1
fragments 1
or 1
till 1
those 1
who 1
fancied 1
they 1
possessed 1
the 1
works 1
of 1
some 1
great 1
man 1
find 1
that 1

others 1
we 1
shall 1
feel 1
better 1
satisfied 1
of 1
the 1
utter 1
uncertainty 1
of 1
criticism 1
than 1
of 1
the 1
apocryphal 1

theory 1

species 1
of 1
sagacity 1

upon 1
as 1

literary 1
novelty 1
justus 1

a 1
scholar 1
of 1
no 1
ordinary 1
skill 1
seems 1
to 1
revel 1
in 1
the 1
imaginary 1
discovery 1
that 1
the 1
tragedies 1
attributed 1
to 1
seneca 1
are 1
by 1
four 1
different 1
authors 1
now 1
i 1
will 1
venture 1
to 1
assert 1
that 1
these 1
tragedies 1
are 1
so 1
uniform 1
not 1
only 1
in 1
their 1
borrowed 1
phraseologya 1
phraseology 1
with 1
which 1
writers 1
like 1
boethius 1
and 1
saxo 1
grammaticus 1
were 1
more 1
charmed 1
than 1
ourselvesin 1
their 1
freedom 1
from 1
real 1
poetry 1
and 1

but 1
not 1
least 1
in 1
an 1
ultrarefined 1
and 1
consistent 1
abandonment 1
of 1
good 1
taste 1
that 1
few 1
writers 1
of 1

sagacity 1
father 1

astonished 1
the 1
world 1
with 1
the 1
startling 1
announcement 1
that 1
the 1
aeneid 1
of 1
virgil 1
and 1
the 1
satires 1
of 1

were 1
literary 1
deceptions 1
now 1
without 1

to 1
say 1
one 1
word 1
of 1
disrespect 1
against 1
the 1
industry 1
and 1
learningnay 1
the 1
refined 1
acutenesswhich 1
scholars 1
like 1
wolf 1
have 1
bestowed 1
upon 1
this 1
subject 1
i 1
must 1
express 1
my 1
fears 1
that 1
many 1
of 1
our 1
modern 1
homeric 1
theories 1
will 1
become 1
matter 1
for 1
the 1
surprise 1
and 1
entertainment 1
rather 1
than 1
the 1
instruction 1
of 1
posterity 1
nor 1
can 1
i 1
help 1
thinking 1
that 1
the 1
literary 1
history 1
of 1
more 1
recent 1
times 1
will 1
account 1
for 1
many 1
points 1
of 1
difficulty 1
in 1
the 1
transmission 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
and 1
odyssey 1
to 1
a 1
period 1
so 1
remote 1
from 1
that 1
of 1
their 1
first 1
creation 1
i 1
have 1
already 1
expressed 1
my 1
belief 1
that 1
the 1
labours 1
of 1
peisistratus 1
were 1
of 1
a 1
purely 1
editorial 1
character 1
and 1
there 1
seems 1
no 1
more 1
reason 1
why 1
corrupt 1
and 1
imperfect 1
editions 1
of 1
homer 1
may 1
not 1
have 1
been 1
abroad 1
in 1
his 1
day 1
than 1
that 1
the 1
poems 1
of 1
valerius 1
flaccus 1
and 1
tibullus 1
should 1
have 1
given 1
so 1
much 1
trouble 1
to 1
poggio 1
scaliger 1
and 1
others 1
but 1
after 1
all 1
the 1
main 1
fault 1
in 1
all 1
the 1
homeric 1
theories 1
is 1
that 1
they 1
demand 1
too 1
great 1
a 1
sacrifice 1
of 1
those 1
feelings 1
to 1
which 1
poetry 1
most 1
powerfully 1
appeals 1
and 1
which 1
are 1
its 1
most 1
fitting 1
judges 1
the 1
ingenuity 1
which 1
has 1
sought 1
to 1
rob 1
us 1
of 1
the 1
name 1
and 1
existence 1
of 1
homer 1
does 1
too 1
much 1
violence 1
to 1
that 1
inward 1
emotion 1
which 1
makes 1
our 1
whole 1
soul 1
yearn 1
with 1
love 1
and 1
admiration 1
for 1
the 1
blind 1
bard 1
of 1
chios 1
to 1
believe 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
a 1
mere 1
compiler 1
is 1
to 1
degrade 1
the 1
powers 1
of 1
human 1
invention 1
to 1
elevate 1
analytical 1
judgment 1
at 1
the 1
expense 1
of 1
the 1
most 1
ennobling 1
impulses 1
of 1
the 1
soul 1
and 1
to 1
forget 1
the 1
ocean 1
in 1
the 1
contemplation 1
of 1
a 1
polypus 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
catholicity 1
so 1
to 1
speak 1
in 1
the 1
very 1
name 1
of 1
homer 1
our 1
faith 1
in 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
the 1
iliad 1
may 1
be 1
a 1
mistaken 1
one 1
but 1
as 1
yet 1
nobody 1
has 1
taught 1
us 1
a 1
better 1
while 1
however 1
i 1
look 1
upon 1
the 1
belief 1
in 1
homer 1
as 1
one 1
that 1
has 1
nature 1
herself 1
for 1
its 1
mainspring 1
while 1
i 1
can 1
join 1
with 1
old 1
ennius 1
in 1
believing 1
in 1
homer 1
as 1
the 1
ghost 1
who 1
like 1
some 1
patron 1
saint 1
hovers 1
round 1
the 1
bed 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
and 1
even 1
bestows 1
rare 1
gifts 1
from 1
that 1
wealth 1
of 1
imagination 1
which 1
a 1
host 1
of 1
imitators 1
could 1
not 1
exhauststill 1
i 1
am 1
far 1
from 1
wishing 1
to 1
deny 1
that 1
the 1
author 1
of 1
these 1
great 1
poems 1
found 1
a 1
rich 1
fund 1
of 1
tradition 1
a 1
wellstocked 1
mythical 1
storehouse 1
from 1
whence 1
he 1
might 1
derive 1
both 1
subject 1
and 1
embellishment 1
but 1
it 1
is 1
one 1
thing 1
to 1
use 1
existing 1
romances 1
in 1
the 1
embellishment 1
of 1
a 1
poem 1
another 1
to 1
patch 1
up 1
the 1
poem 1
itself 1
from 1
such 1
materials 1
what 1
consistency 1
of 1
style 1
and 1
execution 1
can 1
be 1
hoped 1
for 1
from 1
such 1
an 1
attempt 1
or 1
rather 1
what 1
bad 1
taste 1
and 1
tedium 1
will 1
not 1
be 1
the 1
infallible 1
result 1
a 1
blending 1
of 1
popular 1
legends 1
and 1
a 1
free 1
use 1
of 1
the 1
songs 1
of 1
other 1
bards 1
are 1
features 1
perfectly 1
consistent 1
with 1
poetical 1
originality 1
in 1
fact 1
the 1
most 1
original 1
writer 1
is 1
still 1
drawing 1
upon 1
outward 1
impressionsnay 1
even 1
his 1
own 1
thoughts 1
are 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
secondary 1
agents 1
which 1
support 1
and 1
feed 1
the 1
impulses 1
of 1
imagination 1
but 1
unless 1
there 1
be 1
some 1
grand 1
pervading 1
principlesome 1
invisible 1
yet 1
most 1
distinctly 1
stamped 1
archetypus 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
whole 1
a 1
poem 1
like 1
the 1
iliad 1
can 1
never 1
come 1
to 1
the 1
birth 1
traditions 1
the 1
most 1
picturesque 1
episodes 1
the 1
most 1
pathetic 1
local 1
associations 1
teeming 1
with 1
the 1
thoughts 1
of 1
gods 1
and 1
great 1
men 1
may 1
crowd 1
in 1
one 1
mighty 1
vision 1
or 1
reveal 1
themselves 1
in 1
more 1
substantial 1
forms 1
to 1
the 1
mind 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
but 1
except 1
the 1
power 1
to 1
create 1
a 1
grand 1
whole 1
to 1
which 1
these 1
shall 1
be 1
but 1
as 1
details 1
and 1
embellishments 1
be 1
present 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
nought 1
but 1
a 1
scrapbook 1
a 1
parterre 1
filled 1
with 1
flowers 1
and 1
weeds 1
strangling 1
each 1
other 1
in 1
their 1
wild 1
redundancy 1
we 1
shall 1
have 1
a 1
cento 1
of 1
rags 1
and 1
tatters 1
which 1
will 1
require 1
little 1
acuteness 1
to 1
detect 1
sensible 1
as 1
i 1
am 1
of 1
the 1
difficulty 1
of 1
disproving 1
a 1
negative 1
and 1
aware 1
as 1
i 1
must 1
be 1
of 1
the 1
weighty 1
grounds 1
there 1
are 1
for 1
opposing 1
my 1
belief 1
it 1
still 1
seems 1
to 1
me 1
that 1
the 1
homeric 1
question 1
is 1
one 1
that 1
is 1
reserved 1
for 1
a 1
higher 1
criticism 1
than 1
it 1
has 1
often 1
obtained 1
we 1
are 1
not 1
by 1
nature 1
intended 1
to 1
know 1
all 1
things 1
still 1
less 1
to 1
compass 1
the 1
powers 1
by 1
which 1
the 1
greatest 1
blessings 1
of 1
life 1
have 1
been 1
placed 1
at 1
our 1
disposal 1
were 1
faith 1
no 1
virtue 1
then 1
we 1
might 1
indeed 1
wonder 1
why 1
god 1
willed 1
our 1
ignorance 1
on 1
any 1
matter 1
but 1
we 1
are 1
too 1
well 1
taught 1
the 1
contrary 1
lesson 1
and 1
it 1
seems 1
as 1
though 1
our 1
faith 1
should 1
be 1
especially 1
tried 1
touching 1
the 1
men 1
and 1
the 1
events 1
which 1
have 1
wrought 1
most 1
influence 1
upon 1
the 1
condition 1
of 1
humanity 1
and 1
there 1
is 1
a 1
kind 1
of 1
sacredness 1
attached 1
to 1
the 1
memory 1
of 1
the 1
great 1
and 1
the 1
good 1
which 1
seems 1
to 1
bid 1
us 1
repulse 1
the 1
scepticism 1
which 1
would 1
allegorize 1
their 1
existence 1
into 1
a 1
pleasing 1
apologue 1
and 1
measure 1
the 1
giants 1
of 1
intellect 1
by 1
an 1
homaeopathic 1
dynameter 1
long 1
and 1
habitual 1
reading 1
of 1
homer 1
appears 1
to 1
familiarize 1
our 1
thoughts 1
even 1
to 1
his 1
incongruities 1
or 1
rather 1
if 1
we 1
read 1
in 1
a 1
right 1
spirit 1
and 1
with 1
a 1
heartfelt 1
appreciation 1
we 1
are 1
too 1
much 1
dazzled 1
too 1
deeply 1
wrapped 1
in 1
admiration 1
of 1
the 1
whole 1
to 1
dwell 1
upon 1
the 1
minute 1
spots 1
which 1
mere 1
analysis 1
can 1
discover 1
in 1
reading 1
an 1
heroic 1
poem 1
we 1
must 1
transform 1
ourselves 1
into 1
heroes 1
of 1
the 1
time 1
being 1
we 1
in 1
imagination 1
must 1
fight 1
over 1
the 1
same 1
battles 1
woo 1
the 1
same 1
loves 1
burn 1
with 1
the 1
same 1
sense 1
of 1
injury 1
as 1
an 1
achilles 1
or 1
a 1
hector 1
and 1
if 1
we 1
can 1
but 1
attain 1
this 1
degree 1
of 1
enthusiasm 1
and 1
less 1
enthusiasm 1
will 1
scarcely 1
suffice 1
for 1
the 1
reading 1
of 1
homer 1
we 1
shall 1
feel 1
that 1
the 1
poems 1
of 1
homer 1
are 1
not 1
only 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
one 1
writer 1
but 1
of 1
the 1
greatest 1
writer 1
that 1
ever 1
touched 1
the 1
hearts 1
of 1
men 1
by 1
the 1
power 1
of 1
song 1
and 1
it 1
was 1
this 1
supposed 1
unity 1
of 1
authorship 1
which 1
gave 1
these 1
poems 1
their 1
powerful 1
influence 1
over 1
the 1
minds 1
of 1
the 1
men 1
of 1
old 1
heeren 1
who 1
is 1
evidently 1
little 1
disposed 1
in 1
favour 1
of 1
modern 1
theories 1
finely 1
observes 1
it 1
was 1
homer 1
who 1
formed 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
the 1
greek 1
nation 1
no 1
poet 1
has 1
ever 1
as 1
a 1
poet 1
exercised 1
a 1
similar 1
influence 1
over 1
his 1
countrymen 1
prophets 1
lawgivers 1
and 1
sages 1
have 1
formed 1
the 1
character 1
of 1
other 1
nations 1
it 1
was 1
reserved 1
to 1
a 1
poet 1
to 1
form 1
that 1
of 1
the 1
greeks 1
this 1
is 1
a 1
feature 1
in 1
their 1
character 1
which 1
was 1
not 1
wholly 1
erased 1
even 1
in 1
the 1
period 1
of 1
their 1
degeneracy 1
when 1
lawgivers 1
and 1
sages 1
appeared 1
in 1
greece 1
the 1
work 1
of 1
the 1
poet 1
had 1
already 1
been 1
accomplished 1
and 1
they 1
paid 1
homage 1
to 1
his 1
superior 1
genius 1
he 1
held 1
up 1
before 1
his 1
nation 1
the 1
mirror 1
in 1
which 1
they 1
were 1
to 1
behold 1
the 1
world 1
of 1
gods 1
and 1
heroes 1
no 1
less 1
than 1
of 1
feeble 1
mortals 1
and 1
to 1
behold 1
them 1
reflected 1
with 1
purity 1
and 1
truth 1
his 1
poems 1
are 1
founded 1
on 1
the 1
first 1
feeling 1
of 1
human 1
nature 1
on 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
children 1
wife 1
and 1
country 1
on 1
that 1
passion 1
which 1
outweighs 1
all 1
others 1
the 1
love 1
of 1
glory 1
his 1
songs 1
were 1
poured 1
forth 1
from 1
a 1
breast 1
which 1
sympathized 1
with 1
all 1
the 1
feelings 1
of 1
man 1
and 1
therefore 1
they 1
enter 1
and 1
will 1
continue 1
to 1
enter 1
every 1
breast 1
which 1
cherishes 1
the 1
same 1
sympathies 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
granted 1
to 1
his 1
immortal 1
spirit 1
from 1
another 1
heaven 1
than 1
any 1
of 1
which 1
he 1
dreamed 1
on 1
earth 1
to 1
look 1
down 1
on 1
his 1
race 1
to 1
see 1
the 1
nations 1
from 1
the 1
fields 1
of 1
asia 1
to 1
the 1
forests 1
of 1
hercynia 1
performing 1
pilgrimages 1
to 1
the 1
fountain 1
which 1
his 1
magic 1
wand 1
caused 1
to 1
flow 1
if 1
it 1
is 1
permitted 1
to 1
him 1
to 1
view 1
the 1
vast 1
assemblage 1
of 1
grand 1
of 1
elevated 1
of 1
glorious 1
productions 1
which 1
had 1
been 1
called 1
into 1
being 1
by 1
means 1
of 1
his 1
songs 1
wherever 1
his 1
immortal 1
spirit 1
may 1
reside 1
this 1
alone 1
would 1
suffice 1
to 1
complete 1
his 1
happiness 1
can 1
we 1
contemplate 1
that 1
ancient 1
monument 1
on 1
which 1
the 1
apotheosis 1
of 1
homer 1
is 1
depictured 1
and 1
not 1
feel 1
how 1
much 1
of 1
pleasing 1
association 1
how 1
much 1
that 1
appeals 1
most 1
forcibly 1
and 1
most 1
distinctly 1
to 1
our 1
minds 1
is 1
lost 1
by 1
the 1
admittance 1
of 1
any 1
theory 1
but 1
our 1
old 1
tradition 1
the 1
more 1
we 1
read 1
and 1
the 1
more 1
we 1
thinkthink 1
as 1
becomes 1
the 1
readers 1
of 1
homerthe 1
more 1
rooted 1
becomes 1
the 1
conviction 1
that 1
the 1
father 1
of 1
poetry 1
gave 1
us 1
this 1
rich 1
inheritance 1
whole 1
and 1
entire 1
whatever 1
were 1
the 1
means 1
of 1
its 1
preservation 1
let 1
us 1
rather 1
be 1
thankful 1
for 1
the 1
treasury 1
of 1
taste 1
and 1
eloquence 1
thus 1
laid 1
open 1
to 1
our 1
use 1
than 1

to 1
make 1
it 1
a 1
mere 1
centre 1
around 1
which 1

drive 1

series 1
of 1
theories 1
whose 1
wildness 1
is 1
only 1
equalled 1
by 1
their 1
