/**
 * File: proxy-options.h
 * ---------------------
 * Defines a collection of functions that can be
 * uses to parse the command line options available
 * to proxy.  In particular, the following
 * option flags are available to the proxy:
 *
 *  --port <port-number>: allows the user to specify a specific port to 
 *                        use instead of the user-specific default
 *  --proxy <proxy-server>: allows the proxy to itself direct traffic to
 *                          another proxy. We impose the simplification that
 *                          the ports for the primary and secondary proxies
 *                          be there same (they would need to be the same in
 *                          practice, but it simplifies parsing considerably.)
